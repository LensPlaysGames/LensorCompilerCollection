1.1 Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Glint is a programming language. This book is meant to teach it (at
  least somewhat). A programming language is not useful in a vacuum
  (literally or figuratively); a programming language is a language that
  allows a programmer to instruct a computer with what to do (and when
  to do it).

  A computer is a broad term, but, for the most part, simply refers to a
  machine that does "work" via a sequence of operations on binary (on or
  off) values. This sequence of operations is called /code/. A
  collection of code that a computer may run is called a /program/. So,
  a program is a collection of code, and code is a sequence of
  operations that tells the computer what to do.

  A program /starts/ at a specific point (usually called the entry
  point). A program is not required to end explicitly, and there are
  various routes through which a program may end up not running
  anymore. A program is said to be /running/ on a given computer when
  operations from that program's code are currently executing on that
  computer.

  A computer has to do operations /on/ something. That is, an addition
  operation isn't useful unless you are actually operating on meaningful
  values. In the real world, computers have all sorts of different
  hardware to make this happen (i.e. CPU registers, ALUs, etc.), but we
  won't get into all of that right now.

  For now, you just need to learn about something called /memory/. A
  computer has to operate on values, and store the result somewhere; it
  also has to store code, and keep track of it's place. Computers often
  store those values in their /memory/ (so they can recall it later).

  A computer's memory may be implemented in the real world in all sorts
  of ways with differing amounts of limitations (i.e. size, speed,
  etc.), but the most important takeaway is that, while a computer's
  memory is made up of binary /bits/ (values that may only be on or
  off), it is addressed via /bytes/. In hardware, a byte (the minimum
  addressable unit in memory) is /usually/ eight bits.

  ,----
  | MEMORY
  | | off on  off off off on  off on | ...
  | | BYTE 0                         | BYTE 1
  `----

  In the example above, each `off' and `on' represents a bit (an actual
  stored value in memory that is either `on' or `off'). Every eight bits
  is labeled as a `byte'. If we were to access any value seen above
  within the computer's memory, we would do so by first /loading/ the
  zero-eth byte from memory.

  To `load' from memory means to copy the relevant set of bits from
  memory. Loading requires a memory address: the index of the byte we'd
  like to load.

  The opposite of /loading from/ memory is /storing into/ memory. A
  value (or values) may be stored into memory, such that further loads
  from that memory result in the stored value(s). Because loading and
  storing both work with memory, they have the same limitations of not
  working directly on bits, but on sets of bits called /bytes/.

  The operations that a computer performs (or, the /code/ that a
  computer /executes/) operate directly on sets of bit values (on or
  off). These values may be written to or loaded from memory for later
  use/re-use.

  As we touched on earlier, even a computer's code is stored in it's own
  memory. That is, a computer's operations are encoded in a binary
  format (such that they may be represented by values that may only be
  `on' or `off'), and those binary values are stored into the computer's
  memory. When the computer is started, the computer loads an operation
  from it's memory, executes it, and repeats. The computer keeps track
  of where in it's memory it is executing via a /program counter/. The
  program counter is also sometimes known as an /instruction
  pointer/. The program counter simply keeps track of which byte within
  memory the current operation is stored at. When the operation is
  finished, the computer may look at the next byte within memory to find
  the next operation.

  There is also a more permanent form of memory known as /storage/. A
  computer's storage is, like memory, a set of binary values (on or
  off). In an ideal world, memory and storage wouldn't be different. In
  the real world, storage is much slower (as it solves a different
  physical problem; it doesn't just store bit values while the computer
  is on, it stores them even without power). For the most part, computer
  /files/ are meaningful, named portions of a computer's storage.


1.2 Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Now that you know what a computer is, and a little bit about how a
  computer functions, we can now learn some basic conventions about how
  all modern computers use that hardware to do useful things.

  Most computers come with code in their memory that may not ever be
  changed; it is locked into the hardware (physical parts of the
  computer machine). This code is called /firmware/, since it is bound
  to the physical hardware, yet it is still able to be changed without
  building a new physical chip. A computer's firmware usually handles
  doing initialisation procedures when the computer turns on, getting
  the computer to a known state. It does this so that the user of the
  computer may write software with a known starting state (it'd be quite
  difficult to guess where the computer has started executing code at,
  if the program counter's value was random every time the computer was
  started).

  That code that the user runs on their computer is known as
  /software/. Most computers these days come with a conventional piece
  of software known as an /operating system/ (often abbreviated
  /OS/). An /OS/ is software that deals with the specifics of the
  particular hardware, such that /it/ may provide a /more/ known
  starting state to /other/ software. An OS usually consists of a kernel
  program that "talks" to the hardware; in reality, it does whatever is
  needed to make hardware do a given operation whenever software
  requests that operation be completed (no actual "talking" involved).

  The programs that an OS runs are usually called "user programs", and
  the known state that the OS provides to software called
  "userspace". User programs are said to run within userspace.

  Glint is a programming language meant to write user programs, so,
  Glint code runs within userspace of some OS on some computer. This is
  important to understand how to get the computer to do what you want it
  to do. /If you want to shoot an arrow and hit a target, you have to
  know where you are standing./


1.3 Tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Now, the weird part is that we actually /use/ computers to do (or at
  least help with) the work of producing code. This means there is
  actually /software/ we use when writing /software/.

  One such piece of software is a /compiler/ program. A compiler
  produces code in a file, given some input. The format that a compiler
  inputs and outputs is not set in stone, and varies depending on your
  particular OS, hardware, etc. A compiler is usually referred to by the
  /language/ the compiler accepts as input. For example, a /C compiler/
  would be a compiler that takes as input the language /C/, and outputs
  code in some other (possibly machine-ready) format.

  A compiler will often tell you when a program is ill-formed; a good
  compiler will tell you where and how. An ill-formed program is like a
  sentence that doesn't follow grammar rules: the sentence will never
  convey any meaning until the rules are followed, as it is
  fundamentally flawed. Some problems in programs mean the program will
  never work; these are usually called /errors/. Other problems are just
  things that are likely to be misinterpreted or often cause confusion
  (like a sentence that starts with "Because"); these are usually called
  /warnings/.

  The file a compiler produces is called an /object/ file. An object
  file is a type of file that stores code and data, and necessary
  information about that code and data.

  An object file must be turned into an executable file via a /linker/
  program before a computer may load it into memory and actually execute
  the operations. An executable file is just a binary format that an OS
  supports loading, like /the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)/. A
  linker's main job is to convert named portions of memory to actual
  memory addresses.


2 Programming in Lensor Glint
=============================

  NOTE: Glint is a language, Lensor is the specification of the language
  described by this book.

  RECOMMENDATION TO READERS: It is my belief that you will learn faster,
  and better understand the concepts presented, if you have a computer
  with /some/ implementation of a Glint compiler present on the
  system. As you read, test yourself by trying to write Glint programs
  that you believe to follow the rules as you currently understand
  them. The feedback the compiler gives you when trying to build the
  programs you write is invaluable in quickly correcting small errors in
  your current mental model.

  I recommend GNU Emacs (or Vim) as an editor, but you may use whatever
  editor tooling you find the most comfortable.


2.1 Introduction, Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1.1 History
-------------

  Glint started in 2023 when Lens_r decided he wanted to make a
  compiler, from scratch, for fun. That compiler needed to compile a
  language, and so he made one up. At first, it had no name, and was
  referred to as "the language the FUNCompiler compiles"; as you may
  have guessed, that grew tedious rather fast, and we needed a name.

  That's when Glint got it's name: /Intercept/. Yes, it was named
  something else for the first year or so. It was renamed Glint when the
  language itself was cleaned up and made more opinionated toward
  important design goals, and the language kind of outgrew it's initial
  version, looking nothing like it used to (and as such, felt deserving
  of a new name).

  The hope is that, even if this language doesn't change your
  perceptions entirely, or blow your mind, you'll be able to see a glint
  of promise in an otherwise dark world `:^)'.


2.1.2 Example Program
---------------------

  ,----
  | ;; Comments may be placed in the source to explain the program and/or make
  | ;; it easier to understand. They begin with ;; and end with a newline or
  | ;; end of file (EOF).
  | 
  | ;; Variable Declaration
  | my/array : [byte];
  | 
  | my/array += `8`; ;; append
  | my/array ~= `5`; ;; prepend
  | 
  | ;; Iteration
  | for b in my/array,
  |   b += 1;
  | 
  | ;; Emit "69".
  | print my/array, `\n`;
  | 
  | ;; Some Glint tooling (namely glintdoc) makes use of special comments that
  | ;; precede declarations. They usually contain @ directives.
  | 
  | ;; @returns the answer to the universe.
  | my/cool-function! : int()
  |   42;
  | 
  | ;; Emit "420".
  | print 10 my/cool-function!, `\n`;
  | 
  | ;; The final expression in the program is returned.
  | 69;
  `----


2.1.3 Program Structure
-----------------------

  A Glint program consists of:
  Header
        The first portion of the file designates module status and
        imported dependencies.
  Comments
        Non-code portions of the file that are used to describe,
        annotate, and document the code portions of the file. Comments
        begin at `;;' and go until a newline or EOF.
  Expressions
        Code portions of the file that are used to tell the computer
        what to do; they are said to "return" a value of some type upon
        evaluation/execution.


2.1.4 Glint Exercise
--------------------

  ,----
  |  1  ;; Declare some variables with initial values.
  |  2  a : int 42;
  |  3  b : byte 27;
  |  4  
  |  5  ;; @returns the sum of parameters x and y.
  |  6  foo : int(x : int, y : int)
  |  7    x + y; ;; adds x and y
  |  8  
  |  9  ;; Invocation of function foo with parameters a and b.
  | 10  foo a, b;
  `----

  The following questions relate to the above example. If you don't know
  the answer to one, just keep reading and move on, it's okay; you can
  come back whenever you are ready.

  1. On what line does the first /expression/ appear?

  2. On what line does the comment with an @ directive appear?

  3. Is there an expression on line 7?

  4. What would the result of the entire program be?

  5. Is there a comment on line 7?

  Extra credit:

  1. How many parameters does `foo' take?

  2. What kind of type is `foo' of?


2.2 Simple Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  or, Literals and Constants, or, Self-evaluating Expressions.


2.2.1 Integers
--------------

  Glint supports decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary integer literal
  formats; all except decimal are accessible through a special prefix
  that begins with `0'. A decimal number literal may not begin with `0'.

  A hexadecimal number literal is prefixed with `0x'. `0xf' has the
  value of `f' in hexadecimal, or `15' in decimal.

  An octal number literal is prefixed with `0o'. `0o25' has the value of
  `25' in octal, or `21' in decimal.

  A binary number literal is prefixed with `0b'. `0b10' has the value of
  `10' in binary, or `2' in decimal.

  Integer literals are always of `int' type.


2.2.2 Bytes
-----------

  Glint makes no distinction between character and integer data types
  (unlike Pascal, and like C).

  Glint provides a way to get the encoded byte value of a character as
  an integer value in the program, and that is to wrap the character in
  ``' (back-ticks).

  ``0`' is equivalent to `48'.

  Often, it can be messy to have control characters appear in the source
  code, so Glint provides an "escape" syntax, such that other,
  non-control characters may represent the control characters.

  Relevant escape characters include `\n' for a line feed, `\\' for a
  `\' (backslash), and `\t' for a tab stop.

  Byte literals are always of `byte' type.


2.2.3 Boolean
-------------

  Logical values that denote veracity of an expression.

  `true' and `false' keywords to access these values.

  Boolean values are always of `s1' (one-bit signed integer) type.


2.2.4 Strings
-------------

  A string allows the Glint programmer to include (textual) data
  directly from the source code into the final program as an array of
  byte values.

  Inescapable strings are wrapped with `'' (U+0027, apostrophe), and
  escape-able strings with `"' (U+0022, quotation mark).

  An inescapable string will contain the contents between the two `''
  (apostrophes), verbatim. *`\' is not special within an inescapable
  string.* An inescapable string may span any amount of newlines.

  `'foo\﻿n'' -> [102, 111, 111, 92, 110, 0]

  An escape-able string accepts the "escape" syntax that byte literals
  also accept.

  `"foo\﻿n"' -> [102, 111, 111, 10, 0]

  For historical reasons, and compatibility with other languages and
  tooling, Glint strings have a NUL byte (value of zero) appended. So,
  the empty string literal `''' contains the bytes `[0]', and is of type
  `[byte 1]'.

  String literals are always a fixed array of `byte', with the length
  set long enough to store the string and the implicit NUL byte.


2.3 Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A variable is a name we give to some Glint construct. In most cases, a
  variable refers to data at some address in memory; as such, it is sort
  of like a labeled, specialty box. The box may only contain the type of
  data the box is declared to contain, and the box may be referenced by
  it's name. Any value may go in the box, as long as it fits both in the
  box and through the opening.

  A variable is a named location in the computer's memory at the time of
  evaluation.  You may store data at this named location for easier
  retrieval later on. The data is stored on a computer, and, as such, is
  in a binary format (just bits). However, Glint makes use of types of
  data that the hardware cannot understand, allowing the Glint
  programmer to write more idiomatic source code. You can think of types
  as an interpretation of the binary bits that are actually on your
  computer hardware when the code is running. The type of data that is
  stored at this location is declared by the programmer either
  explicitly or implicitly in a /declaration expression/.


2.3.1 Declaration Forms
-----------------------

  A declaration expression may take on several different /forms/. All of
  these forms accomplish the same thing (declaring a variable), but in
  different ways and with different requirements.

  The most standard form of declaration expression is an
  explicitly-typed variable.
  ,----
  | x : int;
  `----

  This sort of expression may be read as, "x is an integer".

  This form may be built upon to include an initializing expression,
  placed directly after the type expression. In this way, it is
  equivalent in syntax to an explicit cast expression preceded by an
  identifier.
  ,----
  | x : int 69;
  `----

  This may be read as, "x is an integer with the value sixty-nine".

  There is another form of declaration, though, that allows us to
  shorten a lot of code, and reduce duplicated type names in
  declarations: the type-inferred declaration expression form.
  ,----
  | x :: 69;
  `----

  This may be read as "x has the value of 69". The type of x will be set
  to whatever the type of the initializing expression is (in this case,
  `int').

  *Uninitialized variables are default initialized*, which, for the most
   part, means they have a value of zero (except for dynamic arrays,
   but, we'll get to that).


2.3.2 Type Decay
----------------

  One of the more confusing parts of any type system is declaration type
  decay; as long as you aren't doing anything too weird, you'll never
  run into problems. But, if you are trying to pass functions as
  parameters to other functions, it becomes relevant. For now, just
  understand that some types are quite complex in Glint, but quite
  simple in the underlying implementation, and that means that sometimes
  you want the simple underlying implementation rather than all the
  complexities that come with the Glint type (if that makes any sense).


2.3.3 Scopes
------------

  A /scope/ is a concept of a meaningful collection of declarations. For
  example, the body of a function is within a new scope, such that any
  variable declarations are not accessible from outside the function.

  A Glint programmer may open a scope manually by using a block
  expression; the contents of which is within a new scope.

  Whenever a new scope is created (or /opened/), it is given a parent
  scope; if a name lookup doesn't match in the enclosing scope, the
  parent will be searched until either the name is found or there are no
  more parent scopes.

  ,----
  | x : int;
  | 
  | {
  |   y : int;
  | }
  | 
  | y; ;; Error! Unknown symbol y'
  `----

  The scope structure of the above program might look something like the
  following. (NOTE: Simplification for explanation purposes: leaves out
  global and top level scope).
  ,----
  | root
  | |-- x
  | `--block
  |    `-- y
  `----

  When we "exit" the block expression, the scope is exited as well;
  further expressions are once again within the parent scope.

  If we were to lookup `x' from the `block' scope, we would not find it
  in the enclosing scope, search the parent (`root'), and find it. This
  means that `x' is accessible from the block scope, and it would not be
  an error to use it there.

  On the contrary, if we were to lookup `y' from the `root' scope, we
  would again not find it in the enclosing scope; but, there is no
  parent of the `root' scope, so we are done searching. Because we
  exhausted the search of scopes and did not find a matching
  declaration, that means this symbol is not valid at this point in the
  program. That is why the above use of `y', outside of the block
  expression, is invalid.

  In Glint, shadowing is not allowed, so you cannot actually declare a
  variable of the same name as another if both would be valid at that
  point.

  ,----
  | x : int;
  | { x : int; } ;; Error! Redeclaration of 'x'
  `----

  The following is a non-exhaustive list of expressions which have
  containing expressions that are parsed in a different scope.

  - Block Expression
  - If Expression
  - Else Clause
  - For/CFor
  - Function Body
  - Each Match Expression


2.3.4 Assignment
----------------

  Assignment is the operation of setting a variable's value, such that
  further accesses to the variable result in the set value. Assignment
  uses the `:=' operator (like Pascal). Assignment destructively
  modifies the values in memory associated with the given
  variable. After assignment, any value that was held in the memory
  /before/ the assignment is destroyed, and can not be accessed.

  ,----
  | x : int;
  | 
  | ;; This is an assignment!
  | x := 69;
  `----

  Often, you want to use the variable itself in the calculation of the
  new value of the variable; there are short-hands for lots of
  operations mixed with assignment.
  ,----
  | x :: 42;
  | x += 27; ;; Now, x = 69
  `----


2.3.5 Glint Exercise
--------------------

  Exercise Mission
  - Recognize declarations of any form.
  - Differentiate variable names, types, and initializing expressions.
  - Reason about the values variables have at different points in the
    control flow of the program.

  ,----
  | x : int;
  | y : int = 420;
  | 
  | ;; y := y - x;
  | y -= x;
  | 
  | x := 351;
  | 
  | z :: y - x;
  `----

  The following questions relate to the above example.

  1. What is the name of the first variable declared?

  2. How many variables are declared?

  3. What is the value of variable 'y' when the program starts, and when
     the program finishes?

  4. What is the initial value of 'z'?

  5. What is the type of 'z'?

  6. What is the value of the variable 'x' when the program starts, and
     when the program finishes?


2.4 Basic Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.4.1 Arithmetic
----------------

  Glint programs often need to do basic math; for this, there are the
  arithmetic operators. These include the standard addition (`+'),
  subtraction (`-' ), multiplication (`*'), division (`/'), and modulo
  (`%').


2.4.2 Bitwise
-------------

  On computers, data is represented as bits. Bitwise operations allow
  you to operate directly on the data bits, rather than on sets of bits
  with some applied semantics (i.e. an 8-bit signed byte). Bitwise
  operations include AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.


2.4.3 Implicit Casting
----------------------

  In Glint, the philosophy is that you should have to write less code
  /when you can/. That means that, as long as everything is clear to the
  compiler, you don't need to mark up your program with meaning that is
  already implied. This reduces the code the Glint programmer has to
  write, and, in turn, reduces chances that they may introduce a bug.

  An integer is implicitly convertible to a boolean, and vice versa.

  For integer to integer casts, it is valid if the bitwidth we are
  casting from is less than or equal to the bitwidth we are casting to,
  OR, if the values are known at compile time, if data is preserved
  through performing the cast.

  A struct is implicitly convertible to any supplanted member.

  A fixed array is implicitly convertible to an array view.

  A dynamic array is implicitly convertible to an array view.

  Functions are implicitly convertible to their corresponding function
  pointers.

  Functions with no parameters are implicitly convertible to their
  return type.

  Pointers are convertible to `void.ptr'.


2.4.4 Explicit Casting
----------------------

  To treat a variable's memory as if it were of another type, you can
  explicitly cast a value. To do this, simply invoke the type with a
  single argument of the type you'd like to cast.

  To cast integer `42' to `byte':
  ,----
  | byte 42;
  `----


2.4.5 Glint Exercise
--------------------

  TODO


2.5 Glint's Print
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Often, a program will need to "print" values, such that a human
  running the program may see them. We still use the word "print", but
  we are not referring to printing onto paper; now-a-days, we have
  software terminals which are much faster and cheaper to run than a
  dedicated printer `:^)'.

  In `Glint', the `print' keyword acts as a pseudo-function, and inserts
  code for each argument passed to it according to the type of the
  argument.

  - `void' arguments signal an error.
  - `byte' arguments get printed immediately using `putchar' or similar.
  - `[byte]', `[byte view]', and fixed byte arrays (i.e. `[byte 4]')
    arguments get each byte printed using `putchar' or similar.
  - Otherwise, a call to `format', a function that returns a dynamic
    byte array, is inserted, the contents of that returned dynamic byte
    array are printed, and then the dynamic array is freed.

  Since byte literals are of `byte' type, they get printed
  "verbatim". The following Glint program would print `420' and then a
  newline (line feed character).

  ,----
  | print `4`, `2`, `0`, `\n`;
  `----


2.5.1 Glint Exercise
--------------------

  TODO


2.6 Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~

  An array is a (contiguous) collection of a given element type.

  A fixed array has the amount of elements known at compile-time. This
  is like arrays in the C language.

  A dynamic array has the amount of elements known at runtime. This is
  like vectors in the C++ language.

  An array view is a non-owning view of a contiguous collection of
  elements of a given type.


2.6.1 Fixed Arrays
------------------

  A fixed array has the amount of elements known at compile-time. This
  means that the compiler is able to check every compile-time known
  subscript to be in range. You should use this type of array if the
  amount of elements never changes.

  The type of a string literal is a fixed array with an element type of
  `byte'. The size of the fixed array is the amount of bytes needed to
  contain the contents of the string literal, plus one for the implicit
  terminating NUL byte.


2.6.2 Dynamic Arrays
--------------------

  A dynamic array may have any amount of elements; any given instance of
  a dynamic array type stores a value regarding it's size.

  A dynamic array's `data' pointer is initialized using the return value
  of `malloc' (A function provided by the C standard library). Glint is
  (mainly) intended to write userspace programs, and as such defaults to
  defining `main' (such that a C runtime may call it). Therefore, Glint
  implementations may rely on the presence of any C runtime functions
  (like `malloc') to implement their features.

  That's right! Dynamic arrays are /always/ default initialized, and
  `data' /always/ points to some memory of size `capacity *
  byte_size_of_element_type'.

  Therefore, the elements of a dynamic array are available via a
  subscriptable pointer at the `data' member. The first element of
  dynamic array `d' is accessible via `@d.data[0]'; there is a
  short-hand that subscripting a dynamic array directly is equivalent to
  subscripting it's `data' member. That means the first element is
  usually accessed using `@d[0]'.

  You can think of a dynamic array type as a shorthand for defining the
  following struct, where `T' is the element type of the dynamic array.
  ,----
  | [T];
  | ;; equivalent to
  | struct {
  |   data : T.ptr;
  |   size : uint;
  |   capacity : uint;
  | };
  `----

  Where `size' is the first invalid index at `data'. `capacity' refers
  to the size of memory located at `data'. If the memory at `data' is
  not large enough to store an inserted element, `data' is reallocated
  and all of the old elements are copied to the new memory.

  An element may be prepended to (added to the front of) a dynamic array
  using the `~=' operator.
  ,----
  | d : [byte];
  | d ~= `9`;
  | d ~= `6`;
  | 
  | ;; Outputs 69, then a newline
  | print d, `\n`;
  `----

  An element may be appended to (added to the back of) a dynamic array
  using the `+=' operator.
  ,----
  | d : [byte];
  | d += `6`;
  | d += `9`;
  | 
  | ;; Outputs 69, then a newline
  | print d, `\n`;
  `----

  Finally, when a dynamic array is declared, memory is allocated; that
  means that, after the dynamic array is done being used, the programmer
  must free it by using the unary minus operator `-'.
  ,----
  | d : [byte];
  | d += `6`;
  | d += `9`;
  | 
  | ;; Outputs 69, then a newline
  | print d, `\n`;
  | 
  | ;; Free the memory associated with the dynamic array.
  | -d;
  | ;; Any further uses of 'd' would be a program error reported by the
  | ;; compiler.
  `----

  A dynamic array is compatible with a ranged for loop expression (more
  on that later).


2.6.3 Array Views
-----------------

  You can think of a view type as a shorthand for defining the following
  struct, where `T' is the element type.
  ,----
  | [T view];
  | ;; equivalent to
  | struct {
  |   data : T.ptr;
  |   size : uint;
  | };
  `----

  A view is meant to act as the minimal representation of a contiguous
  set of elements of a given type; it contains a pointer to the
  contiguous memory where all the elements are stored, as well as a
  value denoting how many elements are stored there.

  A view is compatible with a ranged for loop expression (more on that
  later).


2.7 Conditionals and Control Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.7.1 `if'
----------

  `if' evaluates a condition expression, and, if the result is truthy,
  evaluates a body expression. Optionally, when an `else' clause is
  present, a different body expression will be evaluated if the result
  of evaluating the condition expression is falsy.

  ,----
  | if condition, body;
  `----

  ,----
  | if condition,
  |   then
  | else otherwise;
  `----


2.7.2 `while'
-------------

  `while' evaluates a condition expression, and, if the result is
  truthy, evaluates a body expression. After evaluating the body
  expression, it will jump back to evaluating the condition expression.

  ,----
  | while condition, body;
  `----


2.7.3 `for'
-----------

  `for' is a loop structure that will iterate over anything with `data'
  and `size' members (like dynamic arrays or array views). It provides a
  reference to the corresponding element for each iteration.

  ,----
  | for element in container, body;
  `----


2.7.4 `cfor'
------------

  `cfor' is a control structure that mimics C's `for'.

  ,----
  | cfor init; condition; increment; body;
  `----


2.7.5 `match'
-------------

  `match' selects a control flow depending on which member of a sum type
  is held.

  `match' must handle every possible member a sum type may have.

  ,----
  | match value_of_sum_type, {
  |   .member0 expr;
  |   .member1 expr;
  | };
  `----


2.8 Declared Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.8.1 Structs
-------------

  The most important declared type there is, the `struct'. A struct is a
  way to group other types together in memory, and reference each type's
  value by a name.

  ,----
  | struct {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : uint;
  | };
  `----

  Given an instance of the above struct, setting the value of `x' would
  *not* alter the value of `y', and vice versa. They are unique, named
  points in memory.

  To access these points, you use the member access operator, `.', with
  the object you are trying to access on the left hand side, and the
  name of the member you are trying to reference on the right hand
  side. A member access, as it references a unique point in memory, may
  be assigned to.

  ,----
  | A :: struct {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : int;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | 
  | foo.x := 70;
  | foo.y := -1;
  | 
  | foo.x + foo.y;
  `----


* 2.8.1.1 Supplanted Members

  A struct may have another struct (or sum) type supplanted within it;
  this means that the supplanted type's members are now accessible as if
  they were members of the struct the member resides in. In reality, the
  compiler does generate a unique name for the member and generates code
  to access that member by name; this construct is simply for the
  programmer's convenience.

  ,----
  | A :: struct {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : int;
  | };
  | 
  | B :: struct {
  |   supplant A;
  |   z : int;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : B;
  | foo.x;
  | foo.y;
  | foo.z;
  `----


2.8.2 Unions
------------

  A union is a way to store multiple types in one place in memory. A
  union is only as big as it's largest member.

  ,----
  | union {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : uint;
  | };
  `----

  Given an instance of the above struct, *setting the value of `x' would
  alter the value of `y'*, and vice versa. They /are/ named points in
  memory, but they are not unique. You could say a union gives multiple
  names to the same position in memory.

  If you can't picture why that'd be useful, then you don't ever need to
  use unions; they are really just there so that people who want to
  solve problems a certain way are able to do it that way.


2.8.3 Enumerations
------------------

  Enumerations, often shortened to just /enums/, are named constant
  values.

  Let's say you wanted the number `1' to be called `Success', and the
  number `7' to be called `Erased', to make your Glint code more
  readable, or understandable.
  ,----
  | Code :: enum(int) {
  |   Success :: 1;
  |   Erased :: 7;
  | };
  | 
  | Code.Success; ;; = 1
  | Code.Erased; ;; = 7
  `----

  Enumerators (in Glint) are /just named constants/. As such, the values
  of an enumerator must be known at compile time. The underlying value
  type may be specified within parentheses.

  If you come from Rust (you crustacean, you), see sum types for what
  you may call enums. If you come from C or C++, not too much has
  changed.


2.8.4 Sums
----------

  A sum is a way to store *one of* a group of types in one position.

  A sum type is a lot like a union, except that when you access a member
  of a sum type, it is verified that the member you are accessing is
  /actually/ currently stored in the memory where that member is
  stored. You see, each member of a sum type is stored at the same
  position in memory (like a union), but the sum type also keeps track
  of what member was last assigned to, and, as such, what kind of value
  is stored in it's member memory.

  ,----
  | sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : int;
  |   z : byte;
  | };
  `----

  Given an instance of the above struct, *setting the value of `x' would
  alter the value of* `y', and vice versa. The catch is that, you would
  never be able to access `y' after setting `x'; doing so would actually
  cause the program to exit.

  ,----
  | A :: sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : byte;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | foo.x; ;; program exits here
  `----

  The only way to get your Glint program to continue execution when
  accessing a sum's member is to access the /right/ one. The /right/ one
  is whichever one is currently stored in the sum type. Note that this
  is NOT calculated at compile-time; each sum type stores a value in the
  computer's memory /at run-time/ indicating which member is valid (if
  any). The compiler automatically generates code to update this value
  accordingly whenever assigning to any sum type's member.

  ,----
  | A :: sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : byte;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | foo.x := 69;
  | foo.y; ;; program exits here
  `----

  ,----
  | A :: sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : byte;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | foo.x := 69;
  | foo.y := foo.x;
  | foo.y;
  | foo.x; ;; program exits here
  `----

  The members of a given instance of a sum type may not co-exist at any
  one time. However, over the "lifetime" of an instance of a sum type,
  any amount of members may be valid.

  You may query if a given member is valid using the `has' unary prefix
  operator.

  ,----
  | A :: sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : byte;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | foo.x := 69;
  | foo.y := foo.x;
  | 
  | out : int;
  | 
  | if (has foo.x), out := foo.x;
  | if (has foo.y), out := foo.y;
  | 
  | out;
  `----

  To avoid long chains of `if' expressions used in conjunction with
  `has', as seen above, the `match' expression may be used in turn. In
  fact, there are more benefits to using `match', such as compile-time
  guarantee that every possible member has a control flow to handle it.

  ,----
  | A :: sum {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : byte;
  | };
  | 
  | foo : A;
  | foo.x := 69;
  | foo.y := foo.x;
  | 
  | match foo, {
  |   .x out := foo.x;
  |   .y out := foo.y;
  | };
  `----

  The match expression will execute exactly one of it's named body
  expressions: the one matching the name of the value currently stored
  in the instance of the given sum type.

  The program would not compile if there were no body expression named
  `x' or if there were no body expression named `y'; every declared
  member within the sum type must have an expression associated with it
  in a `match' expression on that sum type.


2.9 Basic Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A /function/ is a concept that programming borrows from mathematics.

  Remember \( f(x) \) in math class? That is a /function
  application/. What it means is that, `f' is some operation (or
  sequence of operations) that we would like to apply to `x'. Hence,
  /application/.

  In programming, we've extended math to suit our use-case; variables
  have types associated with them, for example (not really a thing in
  math: numbers are numbers).

  Functions are no different; programming extends them to better fit the
  common use-cases.

  Just like in math, Glint functions may have any amount of parameters.

  Remember `f(x)' from before? `x' is a /function parameter/. `f' is
  said to be a function with a single parameter. A parameter is a
  variable (as in, it may vary) value that may change upon different
  invocations of the function. You may think of it like a name for a
  placeholder value that will be filled in at some later point.

  On Parameters vs Arguments
        Parameters appear in the function declaration and definition,
        while arguments appear in each function invocation. An argument
        is the value that a parameter takes on during a particular
        invocation of a function.

  NOTE: Function arguments are evaluated "in order"; that is, the order
  they appear /in the function's type declaration/.

  Functions do not /just/ execute an operation, or sequence of
  operations, though. They apply operations in order to form a result
  value, which is then said to be "returned from" the function, upon
  application. In Glint, the result of evaluating the last expression in
  a function is the return value, unless otherwise explicitly returning
  via `return'.

  A function's return value is constrained to be of the declared return
  type of the function (such that uses of the function may rely upon a
  binary format of the returned value).

  NOTE: There is a special built-in type named `void' which declares the
  absence of a valid binary value. Therefore, it is an incomplete type
  and uses of it are invalid. However, it is most used as the return
  type of a function that doesn't return anything; that way, the
  compiler knows not to expect a value to return, and you don't have to
  return an `int' for no reason or something (making future users of
  your module question why in the world you are returning zero from a
  function every time).

  Basic functions allow the programmer to de-duplicate code, increase
  readability, and form custom control flow.

  You should write a function when you find yourself writing the same
  set of expressions over and over, with just a few values swapped out
  for another in each set. Instead, extract that set of expressions into
  a function body, then invoke that function each time you need to do
  that set of operations.

  Basic function example:
  ,----
  | foo : [int 2] !{ 69, 42 };
  | bar : [int 2] !{ 27, 42 };
  | baz : [int 2] !{ 64920, 42 };
  | 
  | @foo[1] *= 10;
  | @bar[1] *= 10;
  | @baz[1] *= 10;
  `----

  With a function:
  ,----
  | foo : [int 2] !{ 69, 42 };
  | bar : [int 2] !{ 27, 42 };
  | baz : [int 2] !{ 64920, 42 };
  | 
  | ten_times_second : void(x : [int 2])
  |   @x[1] *= 10;
  | 
  | ten_times_second foo;
  | ten_times_second bar;
  | ten_times_second baz;
  `----

  As you can see, when proper names are picked, functions increase the
  ability for code readers to understand what the code is trying to do
  (vs what it may actually be doing). They also allow for easier
  refactors; imagine you want to also multiply the first value of every
  array by 3. That would be one expression, one extra line of Glint code
  to write in the function body. Without a function, you'd have to write
  and edit that line of code where every invocation is! For this simple
  example, it would be doable, but, with a large and growing codebase,
  that becomes more and more difficult.


2.9.1 Function Attributes
-------------------------


2.10 Pointers and References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  We've talked a little about how variables (for the most part) are
  named locations in the computer's memory. When we say memory, we mean
  it's RAM (/Random Access Memory/). RAM is (usually) a linear set of
  addressable bytes that the CPU may read from and write to.

  When we say /addressable/, we mean that there is a unique way of
  referring to each and every byte within that linear set. Mostly, this
  is done simply by index, and we call this index a /memory address/.

  A /pointer/ is simply a memory address; an index into that linear set
  of bytes that the CPU can do whatever it wants with. In Glint,
  pointers have an associated underlying type; the type tells Glint how
  to interpret the value in memory at that memory address. So, a value
  of type `int.ptr' (a pointer to an integer) will be some index into
  the linear memory array; we don't really care what it is. If we were
  to `load' the value at that memory address (technically the next eight
  values, since an `int' is eight bytes), we would then have a value of
  type `int'.

  In Glint, subscripting is the act of offsetting a pointer by some
  multiple of the size of a given type. So, to continue with our last
  example, subscripting a value of type `int.ptr' by one would increase
  the value by eight, since that is the size in bytes of an integer. The
  idea is, the first subscript of a pointer gets the address where the
  next element in contiguous memory would be, if there were one. This
  applies to every value, not just the first, so the zero-eth subscript
  leaves the pointer unchanged, while the second subscript increases the
  pointer by the size of two elements (sixteen bytes in the case of
  `int.ptr').

  Do keep in mind that, unlike most other languages, Glint's subscript
  does *NOT* dereference. That is, the act of subscripting does not load
  any values in Glint; it simply calculates the memory address. In order
  to load a value from a memory address, you have to dereference it. In
  Glint, that is done via the unary prefix operator `@' (i.e. get the
  value "at" the given memory address).


2.11 Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Templates, at their core, are expressions which evaluate to other
  expressions.

  A template is a special form of expression that results in an
  expression upon evaluation. You can think of it as code that generates
  code.

  This is often useful when you have some expression (or set of
  expressions) that end up being duplicated throughout a function, with
  just a few values swapped out for different ones here and there.

  First, let's look at the most basic template expression: the
  /identity/ template.

  ,----
  | template(x : expr) x;
  `----

  This template expression, when invoked with an expression, would
  evaluate to that argument expression unchanged.

  Often, you want to use a template more than once; for convenience, a
  Glint programmer may name a template expression. This may also improve
  readability. Remember that templates are NOT functions! They are their
  own type of invocable (callable) expression.

  ,----
  | identity :: template(x : expr) x;
  | 
  | ;; Evaluates to '69420'.
  | identity 69420;
  `----


2.12 Function Overloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Glint supports /function overloading/, which is the idea of giving
  multiple definitions to a single, named function; each definition
  differs in their signature (return type and/or parameter types), and
  the compiler determines which definition to call at each call site
  based on the types of the argument expressions.

  ,----
  | ;; [0]
  | make_byte : byte(v : int)
  |   byte v;
  | 
  | ;; [1]
  | make_byte : byte(v : byte)
  |   v;
  | 
  | make_byte 69; ;; calls [0]
  | make_byte `0`; ;; calls [1]
  `----


2.13 Operator Overloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  /Operators/ are tokens, or sequences of tokens, that may be placed
  somewhere around an expression in order to alter the result of the
  expression in some way. Operators may be defined by how many inputs
  they operate on (/arity/), as well as where the operator is placed in
  relation to the inputs (prefix, infix, or postfix). An operator that
  comes before the single expression it operates on would be a /unary
  prefix operator/. An operator that sits between the two expressions it
  operates on would be a /binary infix operator/.

  For simple types like pointers or integers, an operator will map quite
  neatly to one (or a minimal amount of) machine instruction(s), so
  there is really no advantage to defining functions for these
  operations; instead, we insert the instructions directly.

  However, in Glint, a programmer may declare their own types, as well
  as variables with values of those declared types. The programmer may
  want to take advantage of these operators for their own types; to
  accomplish this, Glint inserts calls to specially-named functions when
  these custom types are used in these operators that normally wouldn't
  support them. The programmer may then define these functions
  themselves, customizing the code that runs when these operators are
  used.

  TODO: syntax example


2.14 Templated Functions and Templated Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You do not ever need to implement a vector in Glint, as there is the
  dynamic array type built-in to the language. However, vectors are
  simple to understand, and widespread enough that I believe this to be
  the best (as in least-confusing) example to give.

  A templated type is like a template expression that defines a type.

  ,----
  | vector :: struct (T : type) {
  |   data : T.ptr;
  |   size : uint;
  |   capacity : uint;
  | };
  | 
  | my_vec_of_int : vector int;
  `----

  A templated function is like a template expression that defines a
  function.  The catch here is that the template arguments are all types
  (because, well, templating a function on a value seems an awful lot
  like you may just want to use a parameter instead `:^)'). Because of
  that, the syntax has removed the `(T1 : type, T2 : type)' boilerplate
  in favor of automagically generating them from the amount of unique
  `auto' types in the signature. Notice the `auto' type allows for
  partial definition of a type, just like C++20's concepts.

  ,----
  | vector_push : void(vec : (vector auto.element).ref, val : auto.element) {
  |   if vec.size + 2 > vec.capacity,
  |     vector_grow vec;
  | 
  |   @vec.data[vec.size] := val;
  |   vec.size += 1;
  | };
  `----

  Now, upon invocation of `vector_push', the compiler will first look
  for a defined function with the signature matching the given arguments
  (i.e. `auto.element' is `int'). If it exists, it will call it. If it
  doesn't, it will use the templated function's body as a template body
  and expand it with the given type(s). It will then call that defined
  function.

  ,----
  | vector_push :: template(element : type)
  |   vector_push_impl : void(vec : vector element, val : element)
  |     ...;
  | 
  | ;; Invocations could be thought of like this
  | (vector_push int) my_vec_of_int 69;
  `----

  Basically, a templated function is shorthand to define a template that
  defines a unique function for every unique set of types passed in
  place of `auto' in the parameters.


2.15 Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.15.1 Writing A Module Vs A Program
------------------------------------

  A Glint program is a collection of Glint source code that may be
  compiled and linked to an executable. A Glint program may import Glint
  modules.

  A Glint module is a collection of Glint source code that does not
  compile to executable, but rather a library. This library then may be
  used by a linker to include it's code in a separate executable. This
  library is also used by the Glint compiler to resolve the Glint
  module's metadata that produced it when compiling code that imports
  the module.

  Programs and modules may import modules, but neither programs nor
  modules may import programs.


2.15.2 Exporting Variables
--------------------------

  A Glint module may export any amount of variables, such that those
  variables are accessible by any Glint program or module that imports
  the module. This is done via the `export' keyword, a storage
  specifier. Storage specifiers come before the name, within a
  declaration expression.

  ,----
  | module Foo;
  | 
  | export foo : int 69;
  `----

  Within Glint, you may now put `import Foo;' at the top of a file, and
  subsequent expressions will execute as if `foo : int 69;' was at the
  top of the file (but without having to execute any code for that to
  happen!).

  In practice, this most often makes the symbol associated with the
  variable "visible" to the linker in the generated object file. This
  means that other object files may reference the symbol to access,
  operate on, and interact with the variable.


2.15.3 Importing Modules
------------------------

  ,----
  | import Foo;
  | 
  | foo; ;; equals int 69
  `----

  TODO: Mention Glint compiler not being able to find module metadata.


3 Types
=======

  Just some extra information on the type sub-language. A lot of the
  first portion of the book goes into expressions, and types are used
  within them, but the types themselves are not fully expanded upon in
  one area. That's why this exists.


3.1 Built-in Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ,----
  | ;; architecture-sized integer. 64 bits on x86_64, for example.
  | int;
  | ;; architecture-sized unsigned integer. Same size as 'int'.
  | uint;
  | ;; Boolean: binary value 'true' or 'false'.
  | bool;
  | ;; The nothing type. Declares absence of something (i.e. a function that
  | ;; doesn't return anything).
  | void;
  `----


3.2 FFI Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. These types allow you to
  define variables as if they had a type from another language. For now,
  C is the only supported "foreign" (read: non-Glint) language by the
  Lensor Compiler Collection Glint implementation.

  ,----
  | ;; The convention is to take the primitive integer type from C, and
  | ;; prepend the 'c' character, codepoint U+0063. Where 'unsigned' would
  | ;; appear, instead prepend 'cu'.
  | cshort;     ;; 'short'
  | cint;       ;; 'int'
  | clong;      ;; 'long'
  | clonglong;  ;; 'long long'
  | ;; Unsigned
  | cushort;    ;; 'unsigned short'

3.4 Types with One Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4.1 Pointers
--------------

  You can make a pointer to any type by appending `.ptr'.

  This is a pointer to a signed integer type.
  ,----
  | int.ptr;
  `----

  Pointers may be loaded from, which yields the underlying type.

  ,----
  | value : int
  |   69;
  | pointer : int.ptr
  |   &value;
  | loaded_value : int
  |   @pointer;
  `----

  Pointers may be stored into, which destrucively modifies the
  underlying value.

  ,----
  | value : int
  |   69;
  | pointer : int.ptr
  |   &value;
  | 
  | @pointer := 420;
  | 
  | value = 69; ;; false!!!
  `----

  As you can see, a pointer doesn't store an `int' value, it stores
  somewhere an `int' may be found (upon loading from it). This also lets
  you change the value where that `int' may be found (upon storing into
  it).


3.4.2 References
----------------

  You can make a reference to /almost/ any type by appending `.ref'.

  This is a reference to a signed integer type.
  ,----
  | int.ref;
  `----

  Like a pointer, a reference doesn't store the underlying value, but a
  location where that value may be found. The difference is that a
  reference does not require /explicit/ loading and storing via the `@'
  operator; you can just use it like it's the underlying type.

  ,----
  | value : int
  |   69;
  | 
  | reference : int.ref
  |   &value;
  | 
  | reference -= 27;
  | 
  | value = 42; ;; true!!!
  `----

  ,----
  | reference_example : uint()
  `----


3.5 Composite Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A composite type is a type that is made up of other types; that is,
  these types allow you to group types together.


3.5.1 Struct Types
------------------

  A struct type is a sequential set of typed values that may be accessed
  via a given name. These are called the struct's /members/.

  For an instance of the following struct...
  ,----
  | struct {
  |   x : int;
  |   y : uint;
  | };
  `----

  If `x' was modified, `y' would be unchanged, and vice versa. A struct
  may have as many members as you could feasibly want, and their types
  are not required to be unique. You may have two `int' typed values in
  one struct with different names.


3.5.2 Union Types
-----------------

  A union type is an non-type-safe way of converting between types. A
  union declaration looks a lot like a struct, but the underlying
  semantics are very different. For one, a union is only large enough to
  store it's largest member, and all the members share an address. This
  means that, if one member is changed, all the others are destructively
  modified! For most use cases, you should use a sum type instead. But,
  this is here if you know what you are doing and need to do it your
  way. You are the Glint programmer, after all, you are in total
  control.

  For a real world use case: use unions to convert between a type and
  it's binary format easily.
  ,----
  | union {
  |   value : int;
  |   bytes : [byte (sizeof int)];
  | };
  `----


3.5.3 Sum Types
---------------

  A sum type is a type-safe way of storing a group of types in one
  location. A sum type may only have one of it's members valid at a
  time, and, each time an access is performed, Glint will safely (and
  forcefully) exit the program before any memory errors may occur iff
  the access is not to the valid member.

  A sum type's members are much like a union type's: only one member is
  valid at a given point in the program, and all the members share an
  address. However, the sum type has a hidden `tag' value that stores
  which member is currently valid (if any). Whenever an access occurs,
  this tag may be checked against, and an access to an invalid value
  will error. This means that sum types do not allow you to convert
  between types, like a union, but they do allow you to have one
  variable have "one of a group of" types.


3.6 `sizeof' and `alignof'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  `sizeof T' where `T' is any valid type will return the size *IN BITS*
  of the given type.

  `alignof T' where `T' is any valid type will return the size *IN
  BYTES* of the given type.


3.6.1 On bits vs bytes
----------------------

  Bit alignment is not something that is supported by any real machine
  or language. By definition, a byte is the minimum addressable unit in
  any computer. So, when it comes to alignment of an address, bytes are
  relevant. However, when it comes to the size of a type in Glint, bits
  are definitely relevant, since you may have a `u27' or a `s42'.
