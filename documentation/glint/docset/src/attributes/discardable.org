* Function Attribute: =discardable=

=discardable= is a function attribute which specifies that the /non-void/ return value of the attributed function may be safely ignored, without emitting an "unused expression" warning or error.

#+begin_src glint
  foo : void()
    print "foo";

  bar : int()
    69;

  baz : int() discardable
    69;

  foo; ;; Not an error, since discarding `void` is always allowed.

  bar; ;; Emits a diagnostic regarding `unused expression`.

  baz; ;; Not an error.
  foo; ;; Not an error.

  bar; ;; Not an error (value returned from program is used).
#+end_src

This is needed because, in Glint, it is a warning/error for an expression to produce a value that is completely unused /by default/.

By contrast, in C++, every value is discardable by default, and the default behaviour in Glint is reachable through the =[ [nodiscard]]= function attribute.
