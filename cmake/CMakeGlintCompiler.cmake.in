#
# This file is the pre-configured file that will /actually/ be "included"
# by projects that have Glint as a language. It should set all of:
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER
#   The path to the Glint compiler on this system
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_LOADED
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_WORKS
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_ID
#   A short string to identify the compiler (such as to differentiate
#   between different Glint compiler implementations).
# - CMAKE_Glint_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
#   When a file appears in a targets sources list with an extension that
#   appears in this list, this compiler will be used to compile that
#   source.
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_ENV_VAR
#   The environment variable where the Glint compiler may be expected on
#   the current system.
#
# Expected input configure variables from "Determine" file:
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_ENV_VAR
# - CMAKE_Glint_COMPILER_WORKS
