** [Explicit] Struct to Fixed Array of Byte

A struct assigns an identifier to each member. Each member must take up a unique place in the computer's memory. A computer's memory is addressed via units of multiple bits called bytes. So, a struct is a named layout of memory, of /bytes/. That means that any struct is convertible (explicitly) to the underlying bytes that it represents.

In Glint:
#+begin_src glint
  ;; TODO: not implemented
#+end_src

** [Implicit] Fixed Array to Dynamic Array

** [Implicit] Dynamic Array to Array View

** [Implicit] Fixed Array to Array View

** [Implicit] Enum to Underlying

** [Implicit] Boolean <-> Integer

An integer is convertible to a boolean /implicitly/, and vice versa.

#+begin_src glint
  (0 + true) = 1;
#+end_src

#+begin_src glint
  x :: 0;
  y :: 1;
  if x + y, 1 else 0;
#+end_src
