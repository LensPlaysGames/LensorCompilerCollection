* Glint Programming Language

The Glint programming language is a high level programming language with low-level capabilities. Focused on the programmer, the Glint programming language spearheads ease of use while also letting people who know what they are doing, do it better.

If you are new to Glint, keep in mind that subscript doesn't dereference. =x[0]= is of pointer type, to get the value at that pointer you need to use =@x[0]=. The only way to achieve pointer arithmetic in Glint is through the subscript operator.
