** Testing

Located in [[file:tst/][tst/]].

To run a lot---hopefully all---of the below tests, there is a CMake project with custom targets to run them at CMake build time, ensuring the compiler is up to date (so that you aren't testing an out-of-date version of the compiler after having edited the source code).

** LangTest

See [[file:documentation/lcc/LangTest.org][relevant documentation]].
